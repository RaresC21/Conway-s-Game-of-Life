# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Implementation of the popular zero player game,  Conway's Game of Life written in C#. 
Game developped in Visual Studio 2015. I only include here files that I edited myself. All other files that come when creating the project in Visual Studio are still needed to run the game.

Saving and loading capabilities are somewhat limited and as of yet, crude.
